# Blog Dashboard 

This is a simple Blog Dashboard application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It allows users to view a list of posts, filter posts by user, view post details, and add or delete comments. The application uses the **JSONPlaceholder API** to fetch mock data.

## Features

- **Posts List Page**
  - Displays a list of posts fetched from the `/posts` endpoint of the JSONPlaceholder API.
  - Each post is shown in a card format with:
    - Post title
    - Post body (truncated to 100 characters)
    - Authorâ€™s name
  - Includes a "View Details" link to view the full post.

- **Post Detail Page**
  - Displays the full post title and body, along with the author's name.
  - Displays a list of comments for the post, showing the commenter name and comment body.
  - A form to add a new comment is available, and comments are added to the list upon submission.
  - Simulates deleting a comment by removing it from the displayed list (without making an API request).

- **Filter by User**
  - A dropdown to filter posts by author.
  - Fetches and displays a list of users from the `/users` endpoint of the JSONPlaceholder API.

- **Responsive Design**
  - The application is responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.

- **Bonus (Optional)**
  - **Loading and Error Handling**: Displays a loading indicator while data is being fetched and handles API request errors.
  - **Pagination**: Implements pagination to limit the number of posts displayed per page.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **JSONPlaceholder API**: A free online REST API that provides mock data for posts, users, and comments.
- **Vercel**: The application is deployed on Vercel for easy hosting and scalability.
